## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- background-blend-mode


### What I learned

The very awesome thing I learned from this challenge is blend-mode : 
```CSS 
  background-blend-mode: value;
```


### Continued development

What I wanna focus more on would be flexbox, that thing keep weighing on my shoulders üòÖ.

### Useful resources

- [MDN blend-mode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-blend-mode) - This helped me for you know for what reason üòÅ. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
